# Contact-Form-Testing
Automation testing of a 3 step contact form.

An example of a project that runs tests using TestNG. \
I used Selenium WebDriver to drive the browsers. \
Project created on a PC (Windows 10) 

  A short automation test for a web form with some constants and services available. \
  I've configured TestNG and Selenium to work with Eclipse Jee 2019/09. \
  For these automated tests, I am using Google Chrome (chromedriver). 
  
  Make sure to download the appropriate browsers, files and check the correct versions of each. 
  
  Google Chrome (Version 78.0.3904.108 (Official Build) (64-bit) ) \
  Chromedriver (for version 78 in my case) (https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=78.0.3904.105/) \
  Selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59 (http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=3.141/)
